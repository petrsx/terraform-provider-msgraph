# MSGraph Provider

The MSGraph provider is a very thin layer on top of the MSGraph REST APIs. 

Documentation regarding the [Data Sources](/docs/configuration/data-sources.html) and [Resources](/docs/configuration/resources.html) supported by the MSGraph Provider can be found in the navigation to the left.

Interested in the provider's latest features, or want to make sure you're up to date? Check out the [changelog](https://github.com/Microsoft/terraform-provider-msgraph/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md) for version information and release notes.

Strongly recommended to install [Microsoft Terraform VSCode Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-azureterraform), it provides a rich authoring experience to help you use the MSGraph provider.

Also, there is a rich library of [examples](https://github.com/Microsoft/terraform-provider-msgraph/tree/main/examples) to help you get started.

## Authenticating to MSGraph

Terraform supports a number of different methods for authenticating to Azure:

* [Authenticating to MSGraph using the Azure CLI](guides/azure_cli.html)
* [Authenticating to MSGraph using Managed Service Identity](guides/managed_service_identity.html)
* [Authenticating to MSGraph using a Service Principal and a Client Certificate](guides/service_principal_client_certificate.html)
* [Authenticating to MSGraph using a Service Principal and a Client Secret](guides/service_principal_client_secret.html)
* [Authenticating to MSGraph using OpenID Connect](guides/service_principal_oidc.html)

---

We recommend using either a Service Principal or Managed Service Identity when running Terraform non-interactively (such as when running Terraform in a CI server) - and authenticating using the Azure CLI when running Terraform locally.

## Example Usage

```hcl
# We strongly recommend using the required_providers block to set the
# Azure Provider source and version being used
terraform {
  required_providers {
    msgraph = {
      source = "microsoft/msgraph"
    }
  }
}

provider "msgraph" {
}

```

- `client_certificate_password` (String) The password associated with the Client Certificate. This can also be sourced from the `ARM_CLIENT_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD` Environment Variable.
- `client_certificate_path` (String) The path to the Client Certificate associated with the Service Principal which should be used. This can also be sourced from the `ARM_CLIENT_CERTIFICATE_PATH` Environment Variable.
- `client_id` (String) The Client ID which should be used. This can also be sourced from the `ARM_CLIENT_ID` Environment Variable.
- `client_id_file_path` (String) The path to a file containing the Client ID which should be used. This can also be sourced from the `ARM_CLIENT_ID_FILE_PATH` Environment Variable.
- `client_secret` (String) The Client Secret which should be used. This can also be sourced from the `ARM_CLIENT_SECRET` Environment Variable.
- `client_secret_file_path` (String) The path to a file containing the Client Secret which should be used. For use When authenticating as a Service Principal using a Client Secret. This can also be sourced from the `ARM_CLIENT_SECRET_FILE_PATH` Environment Variable.
